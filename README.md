Final Machine Learning Project: Xiaomei Wang

1. Name of the Project:
   Student stress classifier using machine learning algorithm
2. My Name:
   Xiaomei Wang
3. Brief description of what project is achieving:
   Student stress classifier can predict student stress level as low (0), medium (1), and high (1) when input factors are given.
   The classifier uses Logistic Regression algorithm and Naive Bayes Algorithm as a comparison. Dataset is splitted 80% as training data, 20% as test data. The model can predict Student Stress level based on input factors. It's classification using algorithms to assign data points to predefined categories. It's a type of supervised learning and multi-class classification mode.
